"Multi-Class Skin Cancer Detection and Localization Using Deep Learning"

# Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment.  
This project aims to develop an **automated deep learning-based system** capable of both **classifying** and **localizing** different types of skin lesions from medical images.  
By integrating **CNN architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet)** with **object detection models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)**, the system enhances diagnostic precision and provides visual localization of cancerous regions.

# Project Goals

- Detect and classify multiple types of skin cancer (Melanoma, BCC, SCC, Benign).
- Localize lesions on skin images using object detection.
- Improve interpretability using visualization tools like **Grad-CAM**.
- Create a user-friendly GUI for image upload and result display.

# Functional Requirements
1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Noise removal, normalization, and contrast enhancement using OpenCV.
2. **Multi-Class Classification**
   - Predict lesion type using CNNs (ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet).
3. **Lesion Localization**
   - Apply **YOLOv5** or **Faster R-CNN** for bounding box detection.
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU.
5. **Visualization**
   - Apply **Grad-CAM** to interpret model predictions.
6. **User Interface**
   - Develop a GUI (e.g., with Tkinter or Streamlit) for image uploads and classification.
